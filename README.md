# AiChessProject
Part 1 and 2 of my AI chess project. Part 1 is the initial stage in which, chess pieces needed to be working.
Part 2 contains the completed project in which there are modes to choose from. If you wish to run it I will include information on how to run below.

To run the chess project there are two ways to do so depending on the application used. 
If using Atom please install the Script add-on and run through the script by going to the ChessProject.java file and pressing CTRL + Shift + B This should run the application.
If using IntelliJ it’s a bit more tricky. As the application’s base form would not properly run on IntelliJ. I had to link it up with Java 9. And then run through the Command Line by moving to the folder that the ChessProject was in and then typing “java ChessProject.java”. Or javac instead of Java If that doesn’t work.
